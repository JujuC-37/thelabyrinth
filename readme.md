The Labyrinth
=============

I created this game during a real world gathering. We chose to make our own local theme : "You are not alone"

I chose to use construct 2 to make my game, that i started to discover just 10 days ago.

The graphics were taken made by Chris Hamons from https://opengameart.org/content/dungeon-crawl-32x32-tiles
And those https://opengameart.org/content/templars-abbey made by sunburn
